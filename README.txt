Created a custom jQuery slider that will slide both image and review.  It contains a couple of options.  

One is for the image rotation as each story does not have images to slide.

Second is for color swatches.  The color swatch is used to shoe the same shoe in different colors.

The first image (topOfPage.png) shows the slider with the images and reviews that will slide.

The second image (showingColorSwatches.png) shows the different color swatches and the image that will be replaced.  

The plugin is customerReivews.shoes.js and the minified version of it.

Main.js contains other functions, like testing where you are in the page to add a class to the sticky nav on top.  It also contains the code for the sticky nav.

I used SASS for this project and processed it to CSS.
